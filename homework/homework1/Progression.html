                <p>Tesla Motors has gone well beyond building a functional and luxurious </p>
                <p>car. Not only have they set the highest standards, but they influencing more</p>
                <p>then just the automotive industry in using electric power. With the creation </p>
                <p>of the Gigafactory, Elon Musk is paving the way for an all electrical future.</p>
                <p>The Gigafactory does not build the batteries for it's tesla vehicles that get </p>
                <p>an impressive 250 mile range and accelerate from 0-60 MPH in as little as 2.4 seconds,</p>
                <p>but actually are home to Tesla's new PowerWall and PowerPack. The technologies </p>
                <p>are used to store solar energy for houses and provide constant power, even</p>
                <p>a power outage occurs. But why is this important? Well it shows that the eagerness</p>
                <p>to build powerful lithium batteries to power cars, has caused impressive innovations</p>
                <p>in many other areas that use eletrical power. The vision of the Tesla company</p>
                <p>is to move away from fossil fuels and to instead be powered by clean electrial energy.</p>
