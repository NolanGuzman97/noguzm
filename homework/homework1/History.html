                <p>The creation of the electric vehicle is a series of events that transpired </p>
                <p>to creation of a full functioning practical electric car like the Tesla.</p>
                <p>While some concept ideas were formulated in the first half of the 19th century,</p>
                <p>a working electric car was created near 1890 by William Morrison.</p>
                <p>The vehicle was capable of 14 mph and able to carry six passengers.</p>
                <p>By the 1900's, electric cars became a third of all vehicles on the road.</p>
                <p>However, Henry Ford created affordable gas powered cars that were</p>
                <p>substantially cheaper then electric cars. Then once road systems improved,</p>
                <p>people wanted to explore longer distances, and only gas vehicles possesed</p>
                <p>the mileage to get people long distances. And so electric vehicles would</p>
                <p>continue to be at a stand still with little devlopment, until 2006 when Tesla</p>
                <p>Motors began to take intrest in creating an electric car.</p>
