Need some extra CSS to make the page look a little better. -Cynthia
Need a PHP function to figure out the time elapsed on the page.  -Raeleen  //how many times the game has been played, average time and overall elapsed time.


I'm not sure of all requirements, but I know those things need to be done.

If you need any help. Shoot me an email: cforsythe@csumb.edu
